Final project of The Odin Project's CSS section

Thoughts before starting: This is my work for the final project of The Odin Project's CSS section. I should be able to demonstrate my understanding of setting up an HTML file from scrath and styling it utilizing CSS. I should end up making a lot of containers for each section of the page and use flexbox to move them where I want them. I feel confident in being able to figure out how to get things where I need them to be, given enough time. I hope to demonstrate better understanding of Git, when to commit, and how to write meaningful and succinct messages.
